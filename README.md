# LD47
 The bits and pieces for a game based on whatever the Ludum Dare 47 theme is.

That theme is "Stuck in a Loop." This is an interactive fiction work, improving on my previous attempts in that genre with setting Ink up to integrate with TextMeshPro in Unity (meaning I have a lot more stylistic control).

***
To-Do:
- ~~Set up UI with prefabs~~
- ~~Get Unity TextMeshPro instantiation to work with Ink file~~
- ~~Differentiate voice in chat vs in person~~
- ~~Convert font for SFX voice~~
- ~~Also set up loud voice? (Bold and useful for buttons, as well.)~~
- Write story

   Brad's branch

   Solo branch
