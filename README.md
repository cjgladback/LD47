# LD47
 The bits and pieces for a game based on whatever the Ludum Dare 47 theme is.

That theme is "Stuck in a Loop." This is an interactive fiction work, improving on my previous attempts in that genre with setting Ink up to integrate with TextMeshPro in Unity (meaning I have a lot more stylistic control).

***
To-Do:
- ~~Set up UI with prefabs~~
- ~~Get Unity TextMeshPro instantiation to work with Ink file~~
- ~~Differentiate voice in chat vs in person~~
- ~~Convert font for SFX voice~~
- ~~Also set up loud voice? (Bold and useful for buttons, as well.)~~
- Write story  
   ~~Dare's branch~~  
   Brad's branch  
   Whitney's branch  
   Solo branch  
   Escapes  
   ~~Solutions~~  
- ~~Make images for characters~~
- ~~Make for backgrounds/settings~~
- ~~Set up background image to change with location~~
- ~~Display array of characters in a location (using Ink LIST of characters, and LIST of states (absent, background, emotions?) with variables for each character?)~~
- Bring speaking character forward (need two y? coordinates to switch between; might be z coordinates in Unity)
- Music/sound effects
- Menu for volume
- OpenDyslexic font sub-ins on menu?
- Extra scene/event images
- Light animations
